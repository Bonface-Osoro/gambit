# Geospatial Access via Multitechnology Broadband Infrastructure Tool (gambit)
This project develops a geospatial, techno-economic integrated model to support universal broadband planning through three complementary systems: mobile (4G/5G), least-cost fixed fiber, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. The model uses spatial optimization algorithms to design the fixed fiber network, and quantifies and compares the capacity, deployment cost, and carbon emissions of all three technologies across varying population densities. It is designed to help policymakers and stakeholders evaluate trade-offs and develop cost-effective, sustainable broadband strategies for unconnected areas. The model leverages open geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and population datasets, and is built using Python-based tools including OSMnx, GeoPandas, and SciPy for network analysis and spatial optimization:

  1) How do mobile (4G/5G), fixed fiber, and LEO satellite broadband technologies compare in terms of cost-efficiency, coverage capacity, and carbon emissions across different population densities??
  2) What is the optimal spatial configuration for deploying least-cost fixed fiber infrastructure in unconnected areas, and how does it perform relative to mobile and satellite alternatives in meeting universal broadband targets?
  3) How can a geospatial, techno-economic modeling approach support evidence-based policy decisions for sustainable and inclusive broadband expansion in underserved regions?
